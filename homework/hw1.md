# Homework 1

For week 1 which covers {ref}`course_intro` and {ref}`signals1`.

## Signals and Classification of Signals

Attempt any of the questions in {ref}`worked_examples_1` that have not been covered in the examples class.

The solutions are in Schaum (2020) **Solved Problems** [1.1 and 1.3-1.8](https://www.accessengineeringlibrary.com/content/book/9781260454246/toc-chapter/chapter1/section/section40#ch01fig17).

MATLAB solutions in video form are available for problems 1.1 and 1.5 from the videos page: [Schaums's Outline of Signals and Systems, 4th Edition Videos](https://www.accessengineeringlibrary.com/search?query=&amp;f%5B0%5D=book_title%3ASchaum%27s%20Outline%20of%20Signals%20and%20Systems%2C%204th%20Edition&amp;f%5B1%5D=content_type%3AVideos&amp;items_per_page=50&amp;scope=selection).

## Supplementary Problems</h3>

Supplementary problems [1.48 and 1.49](https://www.accessengineeringlibrary.com/content/book/9781260454246/toc-chapter/chapter1/section/section41) in Hsu (2020) are related to the content covered in {ref}`signals1`.
