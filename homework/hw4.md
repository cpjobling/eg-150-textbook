# Homework 4

For week 4 which covers {ref}`lti_systems2` and {ref}`Systems_Described_by_Differential_Equations`.

## More on LTI Systems

There are two groups of examples in {ref}`lti_systems2` which you may wish to have a go at. These are {ref}`examples_6` and {ref}`examples_7`. Both sets are examples are annotated to clarify which are examinable (or useful) and which are for background interest only. {ref}`ex6_1`, {ref}`ex6_2` and {ref}`ex6_6` will be covered in [Examples Class 3](https://canvas.swansea.ac.uk/courses/44965/pages/examples-class-3) (Link to Canvas).Â 

The exercises in {ref}`examples_7` are of intellectual inerest but cover material that is *not examinable*.

We went through {ref}`ex8_1` and {ref}`ex8_2` in class (see the [OneNote Class Notebook](https://swanseauniversity-my.sharepoint.com/personal/c_p_jobling_swansea_ac_uk/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={eaa52967-a060-4ca9-bb39-94cb14558be4}&action=edit&wd=target%28_Content%20Library%2FVirtual%20Whiteboard.one%7C6bda5f73-f1f5-1d47-b53b-b1a8780b9592%2FExamples%20Class%203%7C4124a7c3-4f82-bb47-86b9-84a847c8f8a1%2F%29&wdorigin=NavigationUrl)) and I have provided MATLAB solutions also. I did this because they provide a useful introduction to the idea of representing differential equations using analogue computer models. For completeness, I have also provided the full solution to {ref}`ex8_3`. The remaining examples in {ref}`examples8` are optional.
