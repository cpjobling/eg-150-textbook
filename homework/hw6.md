# Homework 6

For week 6 which covers {ref}`unit4.3` and {ref}`unit4.4`.

## Properties of the Laplace Transform and the Inverse Laplace Transform

Review the Homework suggestions in {ref}`unit4.3:hw` and {ref}`unit4.4:hw`.

## Additional Solved Problems (Hsu,2020)

Problems 3.7-3.15 cover Properties of the Laplace Transform. Problems 3.16-3.22 cover the Inverse Laplace Transfrom. Both sets of problems are a rich set of revision materials.

## Supplementary Problems (Hsu, 2020)

Try the supplementary problems. Some of these have MATLAB solutions that would also reward study.
