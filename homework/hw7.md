# Homework 7

For week 7 which covers {ref}`unit4.5` and {ref}`unit4.6`.

## Using the Laplace Transform for Circuit Analysis and Transfer Functions

Review the Homework suggestions in {ref}`unit4.5:hw` and {ref}`unit4.6:hw`.

MATLAB Solutions for some of {ref}`examples12` and {ref}`examples13` will be explored further in [ðŸ¥¼ Lab 05: MATLAB for Circuit Analysis](https://canvas.swansea.ac.uk/courses/44965/pages/lab-5-laplace-transforms-and-transfer-functions-for-circuit-analysis) (link to Canvas).


## Supplementary Problems

The **supplementary problems** in Chapter 3 of Hsu (2020) are related to the content covered in this week's content.
