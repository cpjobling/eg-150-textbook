# Homework 2

For week 2 which covers {ref}`unit2.2` and {ref}`elementary_signals`.

## Periodic, Energy, Power, and Elementary Signals


Attempt any of the questions in {ref}`examples2` and {ref}`examples3` that have not been covered in class. If you find any that are particularly difficult, please nominate them in the [examples request discussion on Canvas](https://canvas.swansea.ac.uk/courses/44965/discussion_topics/404850) for coverage in a future examples class.

The solutions for Examples 2 are in Hsu (2020) **Solved Problems** 1.14, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.20 and for Examples 3 in **Chapter 1: Elemental Signals of Karris** (2012). 

We will also use MATLAB to solve some of these problems in [ðŸ¥¼ Lab 2: Signals and Systems](https://canvas.swansea.ac.uk/courses/44965/pages/lab-2-signals-and-systems?wrap=1).

MATLAB solutions in video form are available for problems 1.1 and 1.5 from the videos page: [Schaums's Outline of Signals and Systems, 4th Edition Videos](https://www.accessengineeringlibrary.com/search?query=&amp;f%5B0%5D=book_title%3ASchaum%27s%20Outline%20of%20Signals%20and%20Systems%2C%204th%20Edition&amp;f%5B1%5D=content_type%3AVideos&amp;items_per_page=50&amp;scope=selection).

## Supplementary Problems</h3>

[Section 1.7 Exercises](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/swansea-ebooks/reader.action?docID=3384197&ppg=40) from Karris (2012) give practice of the topics covered in {ref}`unit2.3` and will be useful for revision. 

Solved Problems 1.21, 1.22, 1.24, 1.25 - 1.32 from Hsu [2020] cover the same ground as Karris (2012) but are not presented in the class notes. 

The **supplementary problems** 1.53, 154, and 1.55 give extra practice.
