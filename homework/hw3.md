# Homework 3

For week 3 which covers {ref}`unit2.4` and {ref}`Response_of_a_Continuous_Time_LTI_System_and_the_Convolution_Integral`.

## Systems and Classification of Systems and Linear Time Invariant Systems

Attempt any of the questions in {ref}`examples4` and {ref}`examples5` that have not been covered in the examples class.

The solutions for {ref}`unit2.4` are in Hsu (2020) **Solved Problems** 1.32, 1.33. 1.3, 1.35, 1.40 and 1.44.  

MATLAB solutions for {ref}`Response_of_a_Continuous_Time_LTI_System_and_the_Convolution_Integral` are given for {ref}`ex5_4` to {ref}`ex5_6` and manual solutions for problems {ref}`ex5_1` to {ref}`ex5_6` are in Hsu (2020) **Solved Problems** 2.1-2.6.

We will do some problems from these sets in [Examples Class 3](https://canvas.swansea.ac.uk/courses/44965/pages/examples-class-3) [link to Canvas].

## Supplementary Problems

**Supplementary problems** 1.56 to 1.51 (not 1.58) in Hsu (2020) are related to the content covered in {ref}`unit2.4`.

**Supplementary problems** 2.46, 2.48, 2.49 and 2.52 are realated to topics covered in {ref}`Response_of_a_Continuous_Time_LTI_System_and_the_Convolution_Integral`.
