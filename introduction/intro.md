## Slido

We will be using a web-based audience response system called Slido for in-class quizzes and informal surveys.

## What are signals?

What comes to mind in response to the question "What is a signal?"

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

**-> Open Poll Question 1 **

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

According to the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/179518) one definition of a signal is:

> A gesture, action, sound, etc., intended to convey warning, direction, or information; an intimation.”

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

In this course we are going to be most concerned with electronic signals which represent physical quantities inside a digital or analogue circuit. So the definition given in the [Signals and Systems wikibook](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Signals_and_Systems/Definition_of_Signals_and_Systems) {cite}`wikibook` is perhaps nearer the mark.

> ”A detectable physical quantity or impulse (as a voltage, current, or magnetic field strength) by which messages or information can be transmitted.“

## What is a system?

What comes to mind when I say "What is a system?"

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

**-> Open Poll Question 2 **

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

According to the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/196665) a system is defined as:

> “A group or set of related or associated things perceived or thought of as a unity or complex whole.”

The definition given in the [Signals and Systems wikibook](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Signals_and_Systems/Definition_of_Signals_and_Systems) {cite}`wikibook` is:

> "any physical set of components that takes a signal, and produces a signal."
