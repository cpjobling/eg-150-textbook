## About this Course

EG-150 Signals and Systems introduces the mathematical description of signals in the continuous-time and frequency domains. Basic properties of deterministic signals and linear time-invariant systems are defined. The concept of frequency and frequency domain description of signals is introduced using Laplace transform and the Fourier series representation of periodic continuous-time signals. The modelling and simulation of systems using transfer functions and block diagrams is introduced.


## Course Content

* Signals in time domain: analogue and digital signals, periodic and aperiodic signals, even and odd symmetry signals.
* Waveforms: sines, cosines, exponentials, steps, rectangular and squares, impulses and ramps.
* Time domain operations on waveforms: time scaling, time reversal and time shifting.
* Calculation of waveform properties: energy, power, mean value, R.M.S. value and crest factor.

* Introduction to systems: basic properties; linear invariant systems; convolution and system response; linear coefficient differential equations.
* Using the Laplace transform for the representation of signals and systems in the complex frequency domain.
* The application of the Laplace transforms in electrical circuit analysis.
* Modelling systems with block diagrams and transfer functions and the concept of feedback.

* Periodic signals representation in the frequency domain: the trigonometric and exponential Fourier series.

* The use of MATLAB for signals and systems analysis.
