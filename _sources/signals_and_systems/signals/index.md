# Signals and Classification of Signals

This section is based on Section 1.2 of {cite}`schaum`.

A *signal* is a function representing a phyiscial quality of variable, and typically it comtains information about the behaviour or nature of the phenomenon. For instance, in an *RC* circuit the signal may represent the voltage across the capacitor or the current flowing in the resistor.

* Mathematically, a signal is represented as a function of an independent variable, $t$. 

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

* Usually $t$ represents time.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

* Thus a signal is denoted by $x(t)$.
