    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this unit we have presented the idea of a *transfer function* (or *system function*) that allows us to represent the impulse response $h(t)$ by the Laplace transform $H(s)$. We also looked at the characteristics of the Laplace transform, transform functions for LCCODEs and series and parallel combination of transfer functions. \n",

    "**My main message to you is that, as an engineer faced with a LCCODE to solve, you should use Laplace transforms!**\n",

    "### Take Aways\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transfer function\n",
    "\n",
    "The summary of the time-domain and s-domain transforms are illustrated in {numref}`fig:3-7`. The key result is $Y(s) = H(s)X(s)$ which simplifies the computation of the system response $y(t) = h(t)*x(t)$ which has to be done using time-convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know $Y(s)$ and $X(s)$ we can determine $H(s)$ using\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{H(s)\\right\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characterization of LTI Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous-time LTI systems the causality and stabilty of a system is guaranteed if all the poles of the transfer function are in the left-half of the $s$-plane and the $j\\omega$ axis is included in the region of convergence. That is, if the poles of the system $H(s)$, $s_k$ have real part $-\\sigma_k$, the system will be causal and stable if $\\sigma_k < 0$ for all $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Laplace transforms of LCCODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear constant coefficient ordinary differential equation (LLCODE) of a system involving input signal $x(t)$ and output signal $y(t)$ is given in {eq}`eq:338`. When we take Laplace transforms of this differential equation, ignoring initial conditions, we get the polynomial equation {eq}`eq:339` from which we can determine the transfer function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)} = \\frac{b_M s^M + b_{M-1}s^{M-1}+ \\cdots + b_1 s + b_0}{a_{N} s^N + b_{N-1}s^{N-1}+ \\cdots + a_1 s + a_0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a rational polynomial in $s$ and it can be solved for any input $x(t)$ that has a Laplace transform $X(s)$ by forming\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y(s) = H(s)X(s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and taking inverse Laplace transforms using the Partial Fraction Expansion method discussed in {ref}`unit4.5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several examples are given in {ref}`examples12` in which the problems given in {ref}`examples8` of {ref}`unit3.3` are redone as Laplace transform problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Block diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex systems can be broken down into subsystems which may be represented by block diagrams which have either series or parallel connections (see {numref}`Fig:3-8` and {numref}`Fig:3-9` and feedback (See {ref}`ex:13.8`)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Still to come\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use transfer functions to solve circuit problems in {ref}`unit4.7` and conclude our study of Laplace transforms in {ref}`unit4.8` with a look at the use of Transfer functions in the MATLAB control systems toolbox and the simulation tool Simulink. We will also look at some of the problems you have studied in **EG-152 Analogue Design** hopefully confirming some of the results you have obbserved in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **EG-247 Digital Signal Processing** we will start from the knowledge gained in {ref}`Unit 4` developing transform ideas further via the Fourier Transform, Z-Transform and the design of systems for signal processing. In **EG-243 Control Systems** you will model feedback control signals using block diagrams and transfer functions. You will also study how knowledge of poles and zeros can be exploited in the design of systems with stable responses."
