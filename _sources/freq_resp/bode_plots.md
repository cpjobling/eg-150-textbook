Steady-state response of of a stable LTI system is $y(t) = M \sin\left(\omega t + \phi\right)$. Screenshot from video [What are Bode Plots?](https://youtu.be/COzQwkeu8Ek?si=XC1h92VGAQWiHV7N&t=28) [t=28 seconds] from {cite}`osorio93`
:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

In {ref}`unit6.1` we explored the idea of a frequency response and showed that, after the transient response of a stable LTI system, subjected to a sinusoidal input $x(t) = A_\mathrm{in} \sin\left(\omega t\right)$ has died away, the steady-state output will be another sinusoid $y(t) = A_\mathrm{out} \sin\left(\omega t + \phi\right)$. 

This is illustrated in {numref}`fig:unit6.2:2`.


+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

We also showed, in {ref}`u6.1:activity`, that you can plot amplitude gain

$$M = \left|\frac{A_\mathrm{out}}{A_\mathrm{in}} \right|$$

and phase shift $\phi$ of the output against frequency to produce a frequency response diagram such as that shown in {numref}`fig:unit6.2:3`.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

The plot of *amplfication* ($M$) and phase ($\phi$), usually plotted against the *log of frequency* $\omega$ rad/s, is called a Bode plot.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

If you are constructing one of these yourself, you need to be sure to use sufficient values of frequency to capture all the important features (such as *resonant peaks* and *corner frequencies*) of the response.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

(unit6.2.4)=
## Calculation of Frequency Response

If we have a system with impulse response (transfer function) $H(s)$, the steady-state frequency response can be calulated by letting $s = j\omega$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

That is the *system function*

$$H(j\omega)$$

can be used to compute the frequency response directly.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

In particular, the **magnitude**

$$M = \left|\frac{A_\mathrm{out}}{A_\mathrm{in}} \right| = \left|H(j\omega)\right|$$

and the **phase angle**

$$\phi = \angle H(j\omega)$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

``` {note}
The magnitude and phase are usually plotted against $\omega$ on a logarithmic scale with magnitude defined in *decibels*:

$$\left|H(j\omega\right|_{\mathrm{dB}} = 20\log{10} \left|H(j\omega)\right|$$

and phase in *degrees*: 

$$\phi_\mathrm{deg} = \frac{180}{\pi}\phi_\mathrm{rad}$$

```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

In MATLAB, we can easily obtain a Bode plot by defining our system as a transfer function LTI model using the [`tf`](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/tf.html) function and passing the system object to the [`bode`](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/dynamicsystem.bode.html) function.

(unit6.2.5)=
## Terminology used

When discussing frequency responses in general, and Bode plots in particular, we need to define some terms that will be used.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

You should should make a note of these for future reference.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### DC-gain

Magnitude $M$ at $\omega = 0$ or DC.

<img src="pictures/dc_gain.png" alt="illustration of DC gain" width="75%" />

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Roll-off rate

The *roll-off rate* refers to the slope of the magnitude plot as the magnitude drops off at high-frequency. It is usually quoted in *dB per decade*[^u62:note:1], where a *decade* is a ten-fold increase in frequency.

<img src="pictures/roll-off.png" alt="illustration of roll-off rate" width="75%" />

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

[^u62:note:1]: Audio engineers quote roll-off in *dB per octave*, where an octave is a doubling of frequency.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

## Natural-frequency

Any peaks in the magnitude frequency response will be associated to some natural frequency in the poles of the system.

<img src="pictures/natural_freq.png" alt="illustration of natural frequencies indicated by peaks in the magnitude response" width="75%" />

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

## Cross-over frequency

In the bode-plot, at low frequency, the gain is 0 dB (or 1). Above the cross-over frequency[^u62:note:2] the gain is less than 1 and the system starts to *attenuate* the input signal. 

<img src="pictures/cross_over_freq.png" alt="illustration of the cross-over frequency in a Bode plot" width="75%" />

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

[^u62:note:2]: The cross-over refers to the change in response from a *gain* ($M \ge 1$) to an *attenuation* $M < 1$. Above the cross-over frequency the system starts to act like a low-pass filter.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

## Bandwidth frequency

Above the *bandwidth frequency* the RMS value of the system is below the RMS value of the input. This so-called *half-power frequency* occurs when $M = \sqrt{2}/2$ or $-3$ dB[^u62:note:3]. 

<img src="pictures/bandwidth_freq.png" alt="illustration of the bandwidth frequency in a Bode plot" width="75%" />

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

[^u62:note:3]: In filter terms, the bandwidth frequency marks the transition between the *pass-band* and the *stop-band*. In control system terms, the bandwidth gives a limit on the frequencies that you can influence with contollers.

## Aysymptotic bode plots for first-order systems

In the remainder of this Unit, we will rely on the explanations given by Carlos Osorio in Parts 3 and 4 of {cite}`osorio93`. This material is also covered in Worked Problem 5.47 from {cite}`schaum`. 

You can always produce a bode plot for a system by use of the tools provided in MATLAB. 

However, a knowledge of the asymptotic behaviour of first and second order poles (the insight gained by Bode in 1938), provides a powerful tool for analysis and design of systems in the frequency domain.

### Exploring Bode Plots for Simple Systems

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Asymptotic bode plot of a gain

If $H(s) = K$ 

The frequency response is $H(j\omega)$:

$$M = \left|H(j\omega)\right| = K,\,\phi = 0^\circ$$

Converting the magnitude into dB:

$$M_\mathrm{dB} = 20\log_{10}(K)$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

The Bode plot for $H(s) = K = 1 = 0$ dB is

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: fragment
---
K = 1; H1 = tf(K,1); bode(H1), grid on
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

Increasing the gain causes a shift in the magnitude plot *up* by $20\log_{10} K$ dB for $K > 1$ or *down* for $K < 1$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### Asymptotic bode plot of an integrator

If

$$H(s) = \frac{1}{s} $$

The frequency response is

$$H(j\omega) = \frac{1}{j\omega} = -\frac{1}{\omega} j$$

$$M = \left|H(j\omega)\right| = \frac{1}{\omega},\,\phi = -90^\circ$$

$$$$

Converting the magnitude into dB:

$$M_\mathrm{dB} = 20\log_{10}(1) - 20\log_{10}({\omega})$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

At $\omega = 0$, $M = 1$, $M_\mathrm{dB} = 0$ dB. At $\omega = 10$, $M=1/10 = -20$ dB. The phase shift is $-90^\circ$ for all $\omega$. The bode plot is therefore:

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: fragment
---
H2 = tf(1,[1, 0]); bode(H2), grid on
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

The roll-off rate is $-20$ dB/decade.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### Asymptotic bode plot of an differentiator

If

$$H(s) = s $$

The frequency response is

$$H(j\omega) = j\omega$$

$$M = \left|H(j\omega)\right| = \omega,\,\phi = +90^\circ$$

Converting the magnitude into dB:

$$M_\mathrm{dB} = + 20\log_{10}({\omega})$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

At $\omega = 0$, $M = 1$, $M_\mathrm{dB} = 0$ dB. At $\omega = 10$, $M=10 = 20$ dB. The phase shift is $90^\circ$ for all $\omega$. The bode plot is therefore:

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: fragment
---
H3 = tf([1 0],1); bode(H3), grid on
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

The magnification increases by 20 dB per decade and there is no limit! This is a bad thing as it will amplify high-frequencies.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Asymptotic bode plot of an single pole

If 

$$H(s) = \frac{1}{\tau s + 1}$$

The frequency response is 

$$H(j\omega) = \frac{1}{j\omega \tau + 1} $$

$$M = \left|H(j\omega\right| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\tau^2\omega^2 + 1}},\phi = -\tan^{-1} \omega\tau$$

This is complex to visualize, so we concentrate on the asymptotic behaviour.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

For $\omega \ll 1/\tau$, $\tau^2\omega^2 \ll 1$, $M \approx 1 = 0$ dB, $\phi \approx 0^\circ$. 

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

For $\omega \gg 1/\tau$, $\tau^2\omega^2 \gg 1$, $M_\mathrm{dB} = 20\log_{10} 1 - 20\log_{10} \sqrt{\tau^2\omega^2} = - 20\log_{10} \left(\tau\omega\right)$ dB, $\phi \approx -90^\circ$. 

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

We can plot this as shown below:

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: fragment
---
tau = 1; H4 = tf(1,[tau, 1]); bode(H4),grid on
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Adding the assymptotes gives

![Bode plot of a single pole with asymptotes added](pictures/bode4.png)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

For most of the magnitude Bode plot, the computed plot is well matched by its asymptotes. The maximum error that at $\omega = 1/\tau$, $M = 1/\sqrt{2}$, $M_\mathrm{dB} = -3$ dB, $\phi = -45^\circ$. The asymptotes used on the phase diagram are usually taken to be 0 at $\omega = (1/10)\tau$ and $-90^\circ = \omega = 10\tau$. In that case, the asymptotes and the actual plot are equal ($\phi = -45^\circ$) at the frequency $\omega = 1/\tau$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### Asymptotic bode plot of an single zero

If 

$$H(s) = \tau s + 1$$

The frequency response is 

$$H(j\omega) = j\omega \tau + 1 $$

$$M = \sqrt{\tau^2\omega^2 + 1},\phi = \tan^{-1} \omega\tau$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

For $\omega \ll 1/\tau$, $\tau^2\omega^2 \ll 1$, $M \approx 1 = 0$ dB, $\phi \approx 0^\circ$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

For $\omega \gg 1/\tau$, $\tau^2\omega^2 \gg 1$, $M_\mathrm{dB} = 20\log_{10} \sqrt{\tau^2\omega^2} = 20\log_{10} \left(\tau\omega\right)$ dB, $\phi \approx +90^\circ$. 

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

 We can plot this as shown below:

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: fragment
---
tau = 1; H5 = tf([tau, 1],1); bode(H5),grid on
```

Adding the assymptotes gives

![Bode plot of a single zero with asymptotes added](pictures/bode5.png)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

Again, for most of the magnitude Bode plot, the computed plot is well matched by its asymptotes. The maximum error that at $\omega = 1/\tau$, $M = \sqrt{2}$, $M_\mathrm{dB} = 3$ dB, $\phi = 45^\circ$. The asymptotes used on the phase diagram are usually taken to be 0 at $\omega = (1/10)\tau$ and $90^\circ = \omega = 10\tau$. In that case, the asymptotes and the actual plot are equal ($\phi = 45^\circ$) at the frequency $\omega = 1/\tau$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### Demo: Using the interactive Bode analysis tool provided by MATLAB

This has to be done in MATLAB for desktop or MATLAB online.

* Open MATLAB and select Bode designer

```matlab
H = tf(1,1)
controlSystemDesigner('bode',H)
```

* Show that changing gain shifts plot up or down.

* Add a pole at about $\omega = 1$ rad/s. Show that moving the pole moves the cross-over frequency.

* Erase the pole and add a zero. Move the zero. Note the HF gain. Move the zero to about 0.1 rad/s.

* Add a pole at about $\omega = 1$. Note that multiplication is addition on phase diagram. Note the pole limits the HF gain and phase returns to zero.

* Add another pole close the first pole and note the roll-off is -20 dB/decade.

* Add a third pole and note attenuation becomes -240 dB/decade.

(unit6.2.7)=
## Aysymptotic bode plots for a second-order system

The model second order system is given by the transfer function

$$H(s) = \frac{\omega^2}{s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2}$$

where $\omega_n$ is the undamped natural frequency and $\zeta$ is the damping ratio.

As we will see, the shape of the frequency response of this system depends only on $\zeta$ and $\omega_n$. Hence knowledge of this plot allows us to easily analysis a system which has factors that are quadratic polynomials in $s$.

Once again, we will rely on the explanation given by Carlos Osorio in Parts 4 of {cite}`osorio93`.

### How to Build Bode Plots for Complex Systems

### Examples of 2nd-order systems

We have already see examples of second order systems in the form of the mass-spring-damper system. Another example from electrical engineering would be the RLC circuit.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

Examples of these systems and the transfer functions that they represent are shown in {numref}`fig:unit6.2:4`

:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

For the mass-spring-damper system

$$H(s) = \frac{X(s)}{F(s)} = \frac{\frac{1}{m} }{s^2 + \left(\frac{c}{m}\right)s + \left(\frac{k}{m} \right)}$$

and the natural frequency is

$$\omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{k}{M}}.$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

For the RLC circuit

$$H(s) = \frac{V_\mathrm{out}(s)}{V_\mathrm{in}(s)} = \frac{\left(\frac{R}{L}\right)s }{s^2 + \left(\frac{R}{L}\right)s + \left(\frac{1}{LC} \right)}$$

and the natural frequency is

$$\omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}.$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Providing that $0 < \zeta \le 1$, the poles of the system will be complex and of the form[^u62:note:10]:

$$p_{1,2} = -\zeta\omega_n \pm j\omega_n \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

[^u62:note:10]: If $\zeta = 1$ there will be two real and equal poles at $s = -\zeta\omega_n$. If $\zeta > 1$ there will be two real poles at $p_{1,2} = -\zeta\omega_n + \omega_n\sqrt{\zeta^2 - 1}$. These cases are already covered in {ref}`unit:6.2.6`. You would just add the Bode plots for the real poles (or their asymptotes) together.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

So

$$H(j\omega) = \frac{1}{-\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_n}\right)^2 + j2\zeta\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_n} \right)s + 1}$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

To evaluate the asymptotes, we will look at the tendences for frequencies before and after $\omega_n$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

For $\omega \ll \omega_n$ the +1 term in the denominator will dominate and

$$\left|H(j\omega\right|_\mathrm{dB} \approx 0\,\mathrm{dB}$$

$$\angle H(j\omega = 0^\circ$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

When $\omega = \omega_n$ the square term will cancel the +1 term and the denominator will become

$$\left|H(j\omega\right|_\mathrm{dB} = 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{2\zeta} \right)\,\mathrm{dB}$$

$$\angle H(j\omega =  -90^\circ$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

When $\omega \gg \omega_n$ the squared term will dominate, and

$$\left|H(j\omega\right|_\mathrm{dB} \approx -40\log_{10}\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_n} \right)\,\mathrm{dB}$$

$$\angle H(j\omega = -180^\circ$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

We have plotted this for the system with $\omega_n = 10$ rad/s and $\zeta = 0.25$ and added the assymptotes:

![Bode plot of a complex pole with asymptotes added](pictures/bode6.png)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

Note that the actual peak is to the left of $\omega = \omega_n$. This is because the actual frequency, often called the *damped natural frequency*, is given by $\omega_d = \omega_n\sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}$. 

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}
