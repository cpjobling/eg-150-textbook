    "•\tare numerical functions of one or more independent variables (e.g. room temperature over time and spatial location)\n",
    "•\tare defined in order to convey some information for subsequent signal processing (eg: to find average room temperature during one day)\n",
    "•\tactual units (e.g.\ttemperature in degrees Celsius and time in hours) not important for signal processing, but it is useful to be aware of them\n",
